## What is WSO2 Updates?
WSO2 Updates is how WSO2 releases improvements to existing products, on top of a released WSO2 product version.

WSO2 delivers improvements to customers in two ways: 

###1.Updates###
        
   **An Update** can be a collection of bug fixes, new features, security fixes, or improvements on an existing product. 
   Updates are delivered through update levels. When an update is applied to a product, the product version goes up by one update level. <br> 
      
###2.Hotfixes###
   
   **A Hotfix** is a bug-specific patch that WSO2 can create for customers-reported bugs. Hotfixes are an immediate fix for a customer-reported issue and will  be applied on an update level. Hotfixes are in the form of a `ZIP file` that 
   needs to be applied on top of the product pack using the update client tool. **All Hotfixes 
   will be included in future updates for all subscribers.**
